ABGM - TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

Overview
The concept for the Automated Batch Group Management (ABGM) tool is to allow administrative control and automatic updating of the membership roster of various groups within institutions (that are controlled by snapshot) based on data coming from SISs. The application allows colleges, departments and advising centers to specifically target information to specified student subsets, as well as allows these groups of students to use the standard Blackboard groups toolset (discussions, collaboration, file exchange).

For example, the chemistry department might have groups automatically created for each advisor, allowing the advisor to conduct his/her own private discussion boards within the organization maintained by the department office. The advising center for the College of Arts and Sciences might have groups for class standing (allowing targeted advising messages for freshmen) as well as groups for at-risk students based on grade point averages. In these cases, it does not make sense to create additional organizations, but rather, groups within the organization.



Requirements
The ABGM tool uses two delimited data files generated externally by other processes. The first, the groups file, defines the groups to be created (names and descriptions), the organizations (Bb course_ids) to which the groups belong, and the initial properties of the groups (tool availability for members). Each line in the text file defines a single group and its properties. The second file defines memberships by user identifier, each line defining a single membership definition.

Example groups file:

course_id|group_id|name|description|available|discussion|collaboration|email|file

ASC.ADVISING|FRESHMEN-ASC.ADVISING|Freshmen|Freshmen in Arts and Sciences|Y|N|N|N|N
ASC.ADVISING|SOPHOMORES-ASC.ADVISING|Sophomores|Sophomores in Arts and Sciences|Y|N|N|N|N
CHEM.ASC.ADVISING|AJONES2-CHEM.ASC.ADVISING|Advisor – Adam Jones|Adam Jones’s Advisees|Y|Y|Y|Y|Y
CHEM.ASC.ADVISING|SSMITH3-CHEM.ASC.ADVISING|Advisor – Sarah Smith|Sarah Smith’s Advisees|Y|Y|Y|Y|Y

Note that some students are placed into multiple groups in this example.

*group_ids will all be unique, but Bb APIs may require course_id as well to properly modify memberships so it shown here; if this is not necessary, the course_id field can be removed.



Administrative Functions and User Interface
ABGM is an administrative tool, allowing the administrator to set a run schedule and data file locations. Scheduling parameters include frequency (weekly, daily, etc) and time of day.  The administrator can set the location of the two data files that are generated by external processes.
